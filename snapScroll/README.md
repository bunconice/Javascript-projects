# 📸 SnapScroll

A simple responsive image gallery that lets users smoothly scroll through images horizontally. It works with both mouse wheel gestures and navigation buttons (Next / Back), adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Horizontal Scrolling** — navigate images like a carousel.

- **Smooth Transitions** — snaps perfectly to the next image.

- **Responsive Design** — adjusts scroll distance based on screen size.

- **Dual Navigation** — scroll with the mouse wheel or click navigation buttons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Event Handling)
